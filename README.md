Rename `_config.json` to `config.json` and specify the following parameters:

|Parameter|Description|

|`username`|Nest account username.|
|`password`|Nest account password.|
|`path`|Absolute path to local folder where content needs to be stored.<br/><br/>Default is the script path.|
|`frame_rate`|Frame rate for the generated video.<br/><br/>Default is 24.|
|`threshold`|Number of images that need to be combined in a video in a single buffer.<br/><br/>Default is 200.|
|`width`|Image width for the capture image.<br/><br/>Default is 1280.|
|`clear_images`|Determines whether images are removed after video is produced.<br/><br/>Default is false.|
|`produce_video`|Determines whether a video is generated after a threshold of captured images is hit.<br/><br/>Default is false.|
|`upload_to_azure`|Determines whether the final video will be uploaded to Azure Storage.<br/><br/>Default is false.|
|`az_account_name`|Name of the Azure Storage account.|
|`az_sas_token`|SAS token for the Azure Storage account. Should have `write`, `list` and `read` permissions.|


**If you want to generate video**, you will need to [download `ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and place it in the `tools` folder, in the script root directory.

Alternatively, if you are on Linux, you can install `ffmpeg` with the help of the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

On macOS, you can install `ffmpeg` through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
brew install ffmpeg
```

## How To Start

Make sure you install the requirements for the project, by `cd`-ing in the folder with the project, and running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `python start.py` after you configured the settings above. Exit by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
